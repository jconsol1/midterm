        <div class="content" id="dev">
            The devastation wrought by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian in Puerto Rico, 
        Florida, and beyond has once again thrust weather and climate disasters to 
        the forefront of the nation's attention.
            According to NOAA, the U.S. has experienced 15 weather and climate 
        disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each in 2022 (as of September 
        30). The total cost of these disasters through the end of September was  
        $29.3 billion. Adding up the final costs will take months after the end of 
        the year to complete.
            The costly and deadly billion-dollar disasters of 2022 so far have 
        included: an April tornado outbreak in the Southeast that spawned 88 tornadoes, 
        including several intense, long tracked tornadoes in Georgia and South 
        Carolina, a May hail storm that left large swaths of golf-ball sized hail across 
        Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota, a destructive derecho that produced widespread 70+ mph wind gusts across the lower Midwest.
            The costs of Hurricane Fiona and Hurricane Ian are still being accounted 
        for as ongoing recovery continues. Historically, hurricanes and tropical 
        cyclones are the most costly disasters by far, averaging $21 billion per 
        event—more than double the average toll of the next most costly event type 
        (drought).

        More Disasters
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        This year's mounting extreme weather costs reflect an increasing trend in 
        billion-dollar disasters across the U.S. Each decade since the 1980s has 
        experienced more billion-dollar disasters and higher costs than the decade 
        before.
            Over the last five years (2017 to 2021) alone, a total of 89 events caused 
        an estimated 4,557 deaths and over $788 billion dollars in damage. That's 
        about 35% of the $2.27 trillion in total costs of U.S. billion-dollar 
        disasters from 1980-2021.
            2022 is the eighth consecutive year with 10 or more billion-dollar weather 
        and climate-related disasters. The long-term (1980-2021) annual average is 
        about seven billion-dollar disasters per year. And 2022 follows the 
        record-shattering annual totals of 22 and 20 billion-dollar disasters in 
        2020 and 2021, respectively.

        More Often
    </div>
    <div class="content">
            It's not just the total number of disasters—but how often they occur—that 
        strains the resources available for communities to manage risks and 
        recover quickly.
            Between 1980-2021, the time between billion-dollar disasters in a calendar 
        year has dropped steadily, according to an analysis by Climate Central.
        The average time between billion-dollar disasters has dropped from 82 days 
        in the 1980s to 26 days in the 2010s.
            In the last five years (2017-2021), there have been just 18 days on 
        average between billion-dollar disasters.
            During 2020, there were as little as two weeks on average between the 
        record 22 billion-dollar disasters that year.
            Less time between disasters can mean less time and resources available to 
        respond, recover and prepare for future events.
            The highest costs have resulted when multiple disasters occur in the same 
        region and season, straining local resources—as during the Atlantic 
        hurricane seasons of 2005 and 2017. According to NOAA, multiple billion-
        dollar tropical cyclones during these two seasons resulted in more than 
        5,000 lives lost and over $520 billion in combined damages.

        The full toll of disasters
    </div>
    <div class="content">
            These staggering figures primarily reflect direct impacts on assets 
        (including damage to homes, crops, and critical infrastructure), and 
        therefore don't reflect the full toll of disasters, including on public 
        health—and especially mental health. According to the American Public 
        Health Association, up to 54% of adults and 45% of children suffer 
        depression after a disaster.
            Weather and climate-related disasters can also result in widespread power 
        outages (as occurred in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona), displacement, 
        and limited or unsafe food and water supplies, as well as loss of cultural 
        heritage, biodiversity and habitats.
            These figures also don't convey the disproportionate impacts of disasters 
        on people in poverty or the need for equitable allocation of federal 
        disaster assistance in accordance with social vulnerability.

    <div class="sectiontitle">
        Disasters in a warming world
    </div>
    <div class="content">
            According to the latest IPCC reports, it is an “established fact” that 
        human-caused greenhouse gas emissions have “led to an increased frequency 
        and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial 
        times.” And these trends are projected to continue with additional 
        warming.
            The ambition of the Paris Agreement—to limit warming to 2.7°F (1.5 °C) by 
        2100—is very likely to be exceeded by the mid-2040s at the latest without 
        rapid emissions cuts. In November, nearly 200 nations will convene at the 
        United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) to accelerate climate 
        action. Without such progress, we can expect even more frequent and 
        intense billion-dollar disasters in the future.
